# 😐 Vinicius Oliveira

> Senior dev — tired but operational. Basically a human microservice.

## 🧠 About Me

- 👨‍💻 I work with React, .NET, Node, and Go... depending on the project’s mood.
- 🧩 Fan of SOLID, Clean Code, and Clean Architecture — even knowing no one follows them 100% in real life.
- 📦 I've built monoliths disguised as microservices. And microservices acting like monoliths.
- 💼 Still pretending everything’s fine in the commits. Spoiler: it’s not.

## 💬 Interests

- Learning more about clean architecture... even when the deploy is on fire.
- Chatting with devs (the living and the survivors).
- Talking about tech, productivity, career — and memes, of course.
